In September 17, 2019, I visited Dahab.

I entered Egypt by ferry from Aqaba in Jordan to Nuweiba, and then took a bus to Dahab.

I arrived at the hotel late at night, but there was no one at the front desk, so I had to wait in the lobby until morning.

There were two big dogs at the front desk, and they were a bit scary.

I needed US dollars for the visa when entering the country, and since I hadn’t researched properly, I broke into a cold sweat — but luckily, I happened to have exactly 25 dollars with me, which covered the visa fee.

The area around Dahab in the Sinai Peninsula was at danger level 3, and I was told that taking the lowest-ranked bus (without air conditioning) carried the risk of getting caught in a terrorist attack.

So I took an air-conditioned bus instead, but there were many checkpoints, and the tension was intense.

Dahab was like heaven — cheap prices, beautiful Red Sea!

Besides the Blue Hole, I saw garden eels while snorkeling, relaxed at cafés, and ate oyakodon at the famous Japanese grandmother’s restaurant.
