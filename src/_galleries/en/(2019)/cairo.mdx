In 2019, when I was 22, the final stop of my trip was Cairo, Egypt! 🇪🇬

I flew home with Aeroflot via Russia — something unimaginable in 2025.

One of my memories of Cairo is struggling to find my Uber — the license plates were in Arabic, and there were way too many cars.
In the end, I gave up, flagged down a taxi, and got ripped off.

My hotel was right in front of the pyramids, and the view from the rooftop was incredible.

On the other hand, people were pretty annoying — the doorman even woke me up at 2 a.m. asking for a tip.

As for the pyramids, the only thing I really remember is how humid and hot it was, but I actually got interviewed outside and ended up appearing on local Egyptian TV. 😂

I bought that “unbreakable paper” as a souvenir, but it’s completely torn now.
