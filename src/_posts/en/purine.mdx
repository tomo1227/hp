Hi!
This time, I seriously photographed food at a popular pudding restaurant I visited in Hokkaido. The only equipment I used was the RICOH GR IIIx. No strobes or LEDs were used, and I only relied on the ambient light in the restaurant for the shots.

First, here’s a shot of the bagna càuda. I'll start by showing some casual shots.

In this one, the broccoli is not clearly visible due to backlighting. If I used a strobe, the shadow in the front would disappear, and it would look much better.

Next, here's a shot from directly above.

The whole plate is visible, and it looks clean, but it feels a bit too flat and not very interesting. It might work well for a menu photo though, as it’s easy to understand.

Here’s how I shot it when I was really focusing on the details.

Even so, I still feel like I want to use a strobe to eliminate the shadows in the front.

Next, I photographed the meat.

There are a lot of shadows here.

It’s not bad, but I prefer the last one.

Next, here’s a dish with beans and meat.

This is what it looks like when taken casually.

I’ve slightly adjusted the shadows in editing, but thanks to the great ambient light, it still looks pretty beautiful even when taken casually.

When I seriously focused on the shot, this is how it turned out.

Now, for the grand finale—pudding!!

Even when taken casually, this pudding looks beautiful and delicious.

From the top, it’s all pudding, pudding.
