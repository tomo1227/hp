I visited Harborland in Kobe after a while!

The view from a café called Franz Café was amazing!

There is another Franz Café on the 2nd floor, but please be careful because it is not connected to the one on the 3rd floor!

On my way back, I stopped by Venus Bridge.
Since I didn’t have a tripod, I took the photos handheld.
