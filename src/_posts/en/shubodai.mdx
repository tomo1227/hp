I visited Shubodai on Mt.Satsuki Driveway. It takes about 40 minutes by car from Osaka.

The Mt.Satsuki Driveway is open from 5:00 AM to 10:00 PM, with a fee of 300 yen.
The entrance is **free** from 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM, when you can enjoy the night view.

There are several observation points, but Shubodai with the torii gate is the most popular.

In addition to the torii, the light trails of the Hanshin Expressway are also beautiful.

I have uploaded photos taken with 14mm, 24mm, 50mm, and 105mm lenses in the gallery, so please take a look!
