The autumn leaves season has come again this year.

I went to see the autumn leaves at Osaka Castle during lunch time because I can go there by bicycle from my house.

Last year, I took photos from the History Museum, but this year I took photos from a different high-rise building.
This time, I did not use a tripod because I was indoors, and I took photos handheld.

First, here are photos taken with a 50mm lens.

Here are photos taken with a 105mm lens.

Because of the thick window glass, the photos look like they were taken with a soft filter, but the view of the autumn leaves was very nice.
